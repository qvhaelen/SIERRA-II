# SIERRA-II
This is a C++  implementation of the classical algorithm based on RREF (Gauss Jordan  pivoting) to compute the linear first integrals of large MAL-CRNs and identify the corresponding sets of dependent and undependent variables. It makes use of some subroutines available from alglib library: https://www.alglib.net/
