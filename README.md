# SIERRA-II
This is a C++  implementation of the classic algorithm based on RREF to compute the linear first integrals of large MAL-CRNs and identify the corresponding sets 
of dependent and undependent variables. It makes use of some subroutines available from alglib library: https://www.alglib.net/
